# Tip Calculator App

This is a simple tip calculator app that allows users to calculate the tip and total cost of the bill per person. The app is written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

The app has the following features:

Users can enter the total bill amount.
Users can select the tip percentage (5%, 10%, 15%, 25%, or 50%).
Alternatively, users can enter a custom tip percentage
Users can enter the number of people splitting the bill.
The app calculates the tip amount per person and total amount per person and displays the calculated values in real-time as the user enters the input.

## Viewing the App

The app is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. It can be viewed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
The app has an optimal layout for each device's screen size.

## What I Learned

I learned how to use the flexible box layout to design responsive layout structures.
I also learned how to create an application that is able to respond to inputs in real-time and is able to catch any potential bad inputs from the user.
Building this tip calculator app has given me a solid foundation in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive web applications.
